# Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies


## 1.Purpose:

The purpose of the analysis is to learn how unsupervised learning is used. By processing data, clustering it, reduce the dimensions, reduce the principal components with PCA. In this excercise we are creating an analysis to prepare cryptocurrency market clustering to build an investment portfolio. The report includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and it's classification for investment.

We processed the infotmation using unsupervised machine learning models using a clustering algorithm and used data visualizations to share findings.

## 2. Accomplishments:
